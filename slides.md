# GraphQL 
## graph query language for APIs

<br>
<v-clicks>

* GQL != GraphQL = Graph Query Language
* created by facebook in 2012 
* presented in 2015 at React.js conference 
* documentary by HoneyPod about GraphQL https://www.youtube.com/@Honeypotio 
* Github started officially use GraphQL in September 14, 2016 https://github.blog/2016-09-14-the-github-graphql-api/


</v-clicks>

<!--
it's not new technology <br>

Graph than we go to Query Languege for API <br>
We will start from the end of the definition for API 
from documentary, one of the biggest staff for creator was that the other big dog without facebok use the GraphQL was Github <br>
In my opinion is the easiest way to understand basics in graphql is use Github GraphQL API
We will start from the end of the definition for API -->

<!-- 
when I need to explain what is API, imagine no IT no tech person <br>
I use this metafor with restaurant <br>
client is client, browser, frontend <br>
kichean - server, <br>
ingredients - database <br>
waiter is the for Example REST API, probably you know this <br>
where is graphQL <br>
in 90% restaurant you get the order, starter and thing about main dish, then main, and last desert <br>
GraphQL you have menu and take starter, main and desert once,<br>
 and you component what you imagine from components, I want rice with chicken and chocleate --->

# challenges

<v-clicks>

* cost for query

* N+1 problem

* monitoring  

* pagination

* depth limiting 

* resolver access for data

* recommend presentation by Jakub Bacic "How to create a production ready GraphQL server"

</v-clicks>

<!-- 
Over-fetching is fetching too much data, meaning there is data in the response you don't use. <br>

Under-fetching is not having enough data with a call to an endpoint, forcing you to call a second endpoint. -->
